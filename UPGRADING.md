# Upgrading

## From v3 to v4 (unreleased)

- The `ShouldBeStored` interface is now an abstract base class. In all your events you should extend it now, instead of implementing it
- the `reset` method has been removed on projectors, use `resetState` instead
- the `fake` method on an aggregate root now accepts a uuid instead of an array of events. Use `given` to pass the events you are now passing to `fake`
- the variable used to accept the event in the apply methods on aggregates is required to be named `$event`

## From v2 to v3

- Add an `aggregate_version` property to the `stored_events` table `$table->unsignedInteger('aggregate_version')->nullable();`
- Republish the migrations or copy the `create_snapshots_table` migration
- The `StoredEventRepository` interface has new methods called `retrieveAllAfterVersion` and `getLatestVersion` that you must implement if you have a custom repository
- The `StoredEventRepository` now accepts an `aggregateVersion` parameter in the `persist` and `persistMany` methods
- The `StoredEventRepository` has a new `countAllStartingFrom` method

## From v1 to v2

Nothing changed, expect that where possible property types and short closures are used

## From laravel-event-projector v3 to v1 of laravel-event-sourcing

The only change in this version is the naming change from `laravel-event-projector` to `laravel-event-sourcing`. There are no changes to the API.

To upgrade from v3 of `laravel-event-projector` you have to perform these steps:
1. Merge the `config/event-projector.php` with `vendor/spatie/laravel-event-sourcing/config/event-sourcing.php` 
2. Rename `config/event-projector.php` to `config/event-sourcing.php`
3. Change `laravel-event-projector:v3` to `laravel-event-sourcing:v1` and run `composer update`
4. The namespace has changed, so you need to replace `Spatie\EventProjector` by `Spatie\EventSourcing` in your entire project
